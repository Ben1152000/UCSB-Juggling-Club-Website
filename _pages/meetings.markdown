## Join us for our weekly meetings!

*We are not meeting in-person for the 2020-2021 school year due to the pandemic, but you can join our virtual juggling session on zoom every Friday from 3pm-4pm on <a href="https://discord.gg/VMv57VejWu">discord</a>!*

During the UCSB school year, we normally meet weekly at the following times:

- Fridays from 3:30-5:00pm on the lawn at the base of Storke Tower.
- Saturdays 3pm-6:30pm in People's Park, Isla Vista, right next to Embarcadero Hall.
