### Join us for our weekly meetings!

During the UCSB school year, we normally meet weekly at the following times:

- Fridays from 3:30-5:00pm on the lawn at the base of Storke Tower. 
- Saturdays 3pm-6:30pm in People's Park, Isla Vista, right next to Embarcadero Hall.

*We are not meeting in-person for Fall 2020 quarter due to the pandemic, but you can join our virtual juggling session on zoom every Friday from 3pm-4pm. [(zoom link)](https://ucsb.zoom.us/j/88388017082)*
