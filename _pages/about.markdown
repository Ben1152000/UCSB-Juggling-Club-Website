## About Us

Juggling club has been a presence at UCSB for decades, and we continue to serve the students at UCSB and the Santa Barbara community. [...]

Every spring, we partner up with the [Santa Barbara Jugglers Association](http://www.sbjuggle.org/) to host the Isla Vista Jugglers Festival in [People's Park](https://www.google.com/maps/place/People's+Park,+Isla+Vista,+CA+93117/), Isla Vista. The festival has occurred annually since 1977 (wow!) and attracts talented jugglers from all across California. The event is held in memory of Patty Laney, a local activist and juggler who, tragically, became a victim of violence towards women. All of the proceeds from T-shirt and ticket sales go to the [Santa Barbara Rape Crisis Center](http://www.sbrapecrisiscenter.org/).
