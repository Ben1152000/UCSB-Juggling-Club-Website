We are a group for jugglers, diabloists, poi-spinners, unicyclists, and circus arts people of all types at UCSB and surrounding areas. Our goal is to give UCSB students a welcoming place to relax, have fun, and express themselves!

We welcome members of all skill levels - if you don't know how to juggle, we will be happy to teach you! Please drop by our [weekly meetings](/meetings)!
