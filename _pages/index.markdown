## What is Juggling Club?

We are a group for jugglers, diabloists, poi-spinners, unicyclists, and circus arts people of all types at UCSB and surrounding areas. Our goal is to give UCSB students a welcoming place to relax, have fun, and express themselves!

We welcome members of all skill levels - if you don't know how to juggle, we will be happy to teach you at our [weekly meetings](/meetings)! Check out our facebook group and if you're a student, feel free to find our club on Shoreline and join our <a href="https://discord.gg/VMv57VejWu">discord server</a>! Juggling club is a welcoming environment to students of all backgrounds, ages, who want to share their unique talents and enthusiasm for learning!

If you've always wanted to learn how to juggle, but don't know where to begin, check out our [guide for beginners](/learn). Make sure to share your progress on our facebook page!

Additionally, residents of Santa Barbara County should check out our sister organization, the [Santa Barbara Jugglers Association](http://sbjuggle.org/). They have a host of incredibly talented and enthusiastic members who meet up weekly in downtown Santa Barbara to show their skills!
