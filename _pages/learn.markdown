## Learn to Juggle

While it may seem intimidating at first, learning to juggle is not as difficult as it may seem. If you follow our guide, you should be able to do the three ball cascade in just a few hours of practice!

Let's get started. First, you should have three balls, bean-bags, or any other round objects. Begin by tossing one of the balls between your hands, back and forth. Try to accustom yourself to the weight of the ball. Practice throwing it from one hand to the other, arcing the ball up to around eye-level. Focus on making consistent throws and catches by feel, as this will help you when you have to pay attention to more than one ball. You'll also want to maintain a steady rhythm between throws. One way to improve your timing is juggling to music. Because songs can have wildly varying tempos, setting your pace to the rhythm will significantly improve your control.

After practicing this for a few minutes, it's time to up the ante. Grab a second ball and hold one ball in each hand. First throw the ball in your dominant hand, and just before it reaches the apex of its arc, throw the ball in your other hand. Then catch both as they fall back into your hands. Don't worry if it didn't look super good on your first try. Keep practicing until you feel comfortable making both throws. At this stage, it's a good idea to switch up the order of the throws and start with your non-dominant hand, since you'll need to do both in order to perform the cascade.

Once you can throw and catch two balls comfortably, try

### Three-Ball Patterns

Now that you've mastered the cascade, here are a few more three ball patterns you should try:

##### Overhand Cascade:

This pattern differs from the regular cascade in that it uses overhand throws. An overhand throw means that the arc of the ball exiting your hand travels lies above the arc of an incoming ball. If you're still confused, try focusing on the motion of the juggler's hands: When you are juggling a regular cascade, notice that your hands rotate outwards, with your right hand moving clockwise and your left hand moving counter-clockwise. The overhand cascade is the reverse of this, where your hands rotate inwards, your left hand rotating clockwise and your left hand moving counter-clockwise. It helps to aim your throws short of your other hand, to a point closer to the middle of your body.

##### Windmill:

The windmill is the same pattern as the standard cascade, but it requires

##### Mill's Mess:

Mill's mess is a fun and neat-looking pattern that is slightly more difficult to master.
